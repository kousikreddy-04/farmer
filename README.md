# 🌱 Smart Kisan - AI Crop Intelligence

**Smart Kisan** is an AI-powered agricultural assistant designed to help farmers make data-driven decisions. It combines machine learning for soil and crop recommendations with a robust Gemini-powered voice assistant, alongside a comprehensive cultivation tracker to manage farm tasks and financial ledgers.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🌾 AI Crop & Soil Analysis:** Input soil parameters (N, P, K, pH) and get highly accurate Machine Learning (Random Forest) recommendations for the most suitable crops, including risk assessments and required precautions.
- **🎙️ Voice-Enabled AI Assistant:** A sophisticated Chatbot powered by Google Gemini that understands agricultural contexts. It features native Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech, allowing farmers to ask questions via voice and hear the responses in their preferred language.
- **📅 Cultivation Tracker & Scheduler:** Once a crop is selected, the app dynamically generates an AI-driven day-by-day task schedule (watering, fertilizing, harvesting) tailored to the specific crop.
- **💰 Financial Ledger:** A built-in expense and profit tracker dedicated to each cultivation cycle, automatically calculating net profit and tracking agricultural investments over time.
- **🌐 Multilingual Support:** Native application support for English, Hindi, and Telugu, enabling accessibility across different demographics.
- **🌤️ Live Weather Integration:** Automatically fetches real-time temperature and rainfall data using the Open-Meteo API based on device gps location.
- **🔐 Secure Authentication:** Full user registration and login flows secured by JWT and bcrypt password hashing.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* **Node.js** & **npm**
* **Python 3.10+**
* An **Expo** account (for mobile testing)
* A **Supabase** Project (for PostgreSQL)
* A **Google Gemini API Key**

### 1. Database Setup
Execute the SQL commands found in `backend/schema.sql` against your PostgreSQL database to create the necessary `Users`, `History`, `Cultivations`, `Schedules`, `Ledgers`, and `Chats` tables.

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file with your credentials:
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
# JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

# Run the Flask Server
python app.py
```
*(Optionally, use the provided `docker-compose.yml` to spin the backend up in a Docker container).*

### 3. Mobile App Setup
```bash
# Navigate to mobile frontend
cd mobile

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Update the Backend URL
# In `mobile/src/constants.ts`, update `API_URL` to point to your local backend IP (e.g., http://192.168.1.X:5000)

# Start the Expo development server
npx expo start
```
Scan the QR code with the **Expo Go** app on your physical device, or press `a` to run it on an Android Emulator.

## 📦 Deployment

**Backend:**
The backend is completely containerized. You can deploy the included `Dockerfile` to any container-hosting service like Render, Railway, or AWS ECS. It automatically installs necessary system dependencies (like `ffmpeg`) and runs via `gunicorn`.

**Mobile:**
To build a standalone installable Android APK:
```bash
cd mobile
npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview
```
Make sure to configure `.easignore` to exclude `node_modules` for faster upload times.
